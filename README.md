# Guide to understand web3-react librbrary

The web3-react linraries have following core modules: 

core: This module contains the core functionality of web3-react. It includes the core context and hook implementations, which are the central components for managing the web3 connection and handling Ethereum-related operations.

components: This module provides a set of pre-built React components that can be used to build user interfaces for interacting with Ethereum. These components are designed to work seamlessly with web3-react and provide convenient wrappers for common tasks like connecting to the network, displaying account information, and handling transactions.

hooks: This module contains additional hooks that can be used alongside web3-react. These hooks provide useful abstractions and utilities for working with Ethereum, such as fetching account balances, monitoring blockchain events, and managing transaction state.

types: This module defines TypeScript type definitions for web3-react and its related modules. 

helpers: This module contains various helper functions and utilities that can assist with common tasks when working with web3-react. These helpers simplify tasks like handling Ethereum network IDs, converting between different Ethereum units, and checking the availability of certain features and the state.

test-utils: This module provides testing utilities specifically designed for web3-react. It includes helper functions and mocks that can be used to write unit tests or integration tests for code that relies on web3-react.
